DOM:
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

DOM is an object oriented representation of an HTML document.

DOM acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself and allows the creation of dynamic web pages

What: You can write JS without understanding much of its concepts.

ECMAScript is a scripting language specification created to standardize JavaScript.

ECMAScript implementations: Javascript, JScript, ActionScript, etc.

Client-side scripting is changing interface behaviors within a specific web page in response to mouse or keyboard actions, or at specified timing events.

Scope: Where to look for things
Lexical Scope: Compile time. All scoping decisions are made during compile time.

Javascript is function scoped.
JS compilation: The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
1st run: Register declarations in appropriate scoped
2nd run: Execution phase, i.e. assignments, func calls

1-Scope.js
A declared variable without an assignment has a value of 'undefined'

Declaration: function keyword should be first word in the STATEMENT(not line), else its an expression.

Hoisting: It is concept that is constructed to understand the behaviour of JS.

Functions: First-class citizens

IIFE :
- Aim is to minimize global scope pollution and create privacy. Wrap the entire code in an IIFE to create privacy. 
- Identifier for the function can be invoked. What if there is no identifier? Then your functionality is safe.
- Parens() is simply a grouping operator to control precedence of execution. It can't contain statements.
It shud contain an expression to evaluate.
- The role of () is to disambiguate between function expressions and function declarations.
- You can pass parameters

	new function(){ /* code */ }
  new function(){ /* code */ }() // Only need parens if passing arguments

Closure:
The ability to nest functions gives us closures.
Closure is when a function “remembers” its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.
Condition: Functions should be nested and inner function should be called from outside.
**let for loop

Module Pattern:
1) There must be an outer wrapping function that gets EXECUTED. Could be an IIFE. If its not an IIFE then it must getting executed. 
2) There must be an object returned from the executing function.
